# harmony-of-the-spheres-vr-unity
Harmony of the Spheres aims to revisit the magic of the once-revered concept of celestial harmony in a standalone application for the Meta Quest 2. Within a virtual solar system, listeners can interact with celestial bodies to explore musical relationships between them, recontextualising this ancient theory within virtual reality.

This is the Unity project folder associated with this project, along with the application package file (har.apk). For the FMOD project folder, see shnayto/harmony-of-the-spheres-vr-fmod
